    "The case involves creating simple implementation of the HTTP server by developing further the starting version you can find below. This approach allows to apply many concepts of network programming in Java language - use of classes and objects, multithreading, use of the Java API (sockets and streams) and use of the data structures (ArrayList). You will need the web browser as a client for your HTTP server.\n",
    "\n",
    "The starting version implements the server which listens on the port 80 for the incoming connections. When the web browser successfully connects, the server creates the appropriate streams which will be used to read the HTTP request and send the HTTP response back to the web browser - a text stream to for reading HTTP request data (text) and a binary stream to send HTTP response, as it may contain text/html or binary data (such as graphics) depending of its mime type. Then, the starting version of the server processes the HTTP request and sends some fixed HTTP response back to the browser. Exercises are aimed at implementing the process of retrieving information from the HTTP request and use them to open, read and send to the broser the content of the requested web page (containg text and grahics). Further exercises are aimed to create multithreaded version of this http server and, finally, to create the HTTPS server."
