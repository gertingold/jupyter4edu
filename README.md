## Jupyter4edu Erasmus+ project,

This repository contains teaching materials used during Erasmus+ project: Jupyter@edu.

## Content

You can find here a collection of noetbooks which have beed used in teaching at European University Cyprus,  University of Augsburg and University of Silesia. They contain  different  approaches to the way of using `Jupyter` notebook and `nbgrader` software. 

### Excercises in scientific programming

[Excercises in scientific programming](https://github.com/marcinofulus/jupyter4edu/tree/master/augsburg/exercises) contain 8 selected  problems in scientific programming. In this approach is has been used in a small class, and the main notebook was given to students. Supplementary notebooks explaining in details some technical aspects are provided to each topic. In this way the materials was  accessible for students with little programming skills. More advanced students can proceed directly to the main problem.

 - [BirthdayProblem.ipynb](https://github.com/marcinofulus/jupyter4edu/tree/master/augsburg/exercises/BirthdayProblem) solves a classical problem of finding two persons have their birthday on the same day of the year  by means of a simulation. It condrawing birthdays at random. The supplemental material contain brief explanation of lists and sets in `Python`: [~ListsAndSets.ipynb](https://github.com/marcinofulus/jupyter4edu/blob/master/augsburg/exercises/BirthdayProblem/~ListsAndSets.ipynb).
 
 - [GameOfLife.ipynb](https://github.com/marcinofulus/jupyter4edu/blob/master/augsburg/exercises/GameOfLife/GameOfLife.ipynb) 
The game of life simulates the dynamics of some living species according to a few simple rules devised by the British mathematician J. H. Conway. The excercise contain its implementation using `numpy` and `scipy` library.  It introduces user to the practical application of discrete [convolution operator](https://github.com/marcinofulus/jupyter4edu/blob/master/augsburg/exercises/GameOfLife/~Convolution.ipynb). An important and attractive element is also visualisation of time evolution of the system using `ipywidgets` interface to `matplotlib` library.

 -  [JuliaSet.ipynb](https://github.com/marcinofulus/jupyter4edu/blob/master/augsburg/exercises/JuliaSet/JuliaSet.ipynb) Julia sets offer a possibility to generate beautiful images. The supplementary notebooks contain in depth explanation of:
     
     - [RGB and HSV color models](https://github.com/marcinofulus/jupyter4edu/blob/master/augsburg/exercises/JuliaSet/~ColorIntro.ipynb),
     - [Color Representation](https://github.com/marcinofulus/jupyter4edu/blob/master/augsburg/exercises/JuliaSet/~ColorRepresentation.ipynb).
     - [Grid data structure](https://github.com/marcinofulus/jupyter4edu/blob/master/augsburg/exercises/JuliaSet/~Grid.ipynb)
     - [Iteration prescription for Julia set](https://github.com/marcinofulus/jupyter4edu/blob/master/augsburg/exercises/JuliaSet/~JuliaIteration.ipynb)
 
 - [Parrondo Paradox])(https://github.com/marcinofulus/jupyter4edu/tree/master/augsburg/exercises/ParrondoParadox)
We will define two games for which the probability to loose exceeds the probability to win. Surprisingly, by choosing an appropriate alternating sequence of the two loosing games, one finds that one wins in the long run. This situation is known as Parrondo's paradox. The notebooks provice guided implementation of simulation algorithm of this phenomena. Supplementary materials explains some aspects of [random number generation](https://github.com/marcinofulus/jupyter4edu/blob/master/augsburg/exercises/ParrondoParadox/~RandomNumbers.ipynb) and provide instructions for implementing all parts of the algorithm [GameA.ipynb](https://github.com/marcinofulus/jupyter4edu/blob/master/augsburg/exercises/ParrondoParadox/~GameA.ipynb),[GameB.ipynb](https://github.com/marcinofulus/jupyter4edu/blob/master/augsburg/exercises/ParrondoParadox/~GameB.ipynb), [AlternatingAB.ipynb](https://github.com/marcinofulus/jupyter4edu/blob/master/augsburg/exercises/ParrondoParadox/~AlternatingAB.ipynb)

- Calculation of [Pi](https://github.com/marcinofulus/jupyter4edu/blob/master/augsburg/exercises/Pi/Pi.ipynb) by means of the arithmetic-geometric mean. This problem is supplemented by [IntegerAsString.ipynb](https://github.com/marcinofulus/jupyter4edu/blob/master/augsburg/exercises/Pi/~IntegerAsString.ipynb).

 - [Symbolic computation Polynomials](https://github.com/marcinofulus/jupyter4edu/blob/master/augsburg/exercises/Polynomials/Polynomials.ipynb)
 https://github.com/marcinofulus/jupyter4edu/blob/master/augsburg/exercises/Polynomials/~Sets.ipynb
 - https://github.com/marcinofulus/jupyter4edu/blob/master/augsburg/exercises/Polynomials/~Setdefault.ipynb
