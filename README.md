## Jupyter4edu Erasmus+ project,

This repository contains teaching materials used during Erasmus+ project: Jupyter@edu.

## Content

You can find here a collection of noetbooks which have beed used in teaching at European University Cyprus,  University of Augsburg and University of Silesia. They contain  different  approaches to the way of using `Jupyter` notebook and `nbgrader` software. 


[Excercises in scientific programming](https://github.com/marcinofulus/jupyter4edu/tree/master/augsburg/exercises) contain 8 selected  problems in scientific programming. In this approach is has been used in a small class, and the main notebook was given to students. Additionally small notebooks explaining in details some technical aspects are provided to each topic. This makes easier for students which have less programming skills to start, while mode advanced ones might proceed directly to the main problem.

 - [BirthdayProblem](https://github.com/marcinofulus/jupyter4edu/tree/master/augsburg/exercises/BirthdayProblem) solves a classical problem of finding two persons have their birthday on the same day of the year  by means of a simulation. It condrawing birthdays at random. The supplemental material contain brief explanation of lists and sets in `Python`.
