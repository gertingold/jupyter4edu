    "The popular programming language [Python](https://www.python.org) provides a package for symbolic computations called [SymPy](https://www.sympy.org). In 2014, Wojciech Czaja started writing the package GraviPy which extends SymPy with functionality useful in doing symbolic calculations in general relativity. The package is available from the [Python Package Index](https://pypi.python.org) (PyPI) as [GraviPy 0.2.0](https://pypi.org/project/gravipy/). In this notebook, we will give an introduction to these packages to the extent needed in the following notebooks."

    "Probably the easiest way to set up a Python environment for the use with GraviPy is to start with the [Anaconda distribution](https://www.anaconda.org) which is a popular distribution in scientific environments. It provides conda, a package and environment management system allowing us to easily setup a Python environment with all the packages needed to run the notebooks in this collection.\n",
    "\n",
    "Assuming that you have the Anaconda distribution installed and its binaries in your path, follow these steps to install an environment for use with these notebooks.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Create a new environment. Instead of `gravipy` you can use also another name for the environment as long as it does not conflict with already existing environments.\n",
    "```\n",
    "conda create --name gravipy\n",
    "```\n",
    "**Important note**: For Python 3.6+, GraviPy 0.2.0+ should be used.\n",

    "1. Activate the new environment. If you have chosen a different name for the environment, you should use it here as well.\n",
    "```\n",
    "conda activate gravipy\n",
    "```\n",
    "1. Install the SymPy package.\n",
    "```\n",
    "conda install sympy\n",
    "```\n",
    "1. Install the GraviPy Package from PyPI. At the time of writing, no `conda` package for GraviPy was available, so that we are obliged to install it with `pip`. Note that in the following command the package name is required, not the name of the environment chosen above.\n",
    "```\n",
    "pip install gravipy\n",
    "```\n",
    "1. In order to run the notebooks in this environment, the Jupyter package needs to be installed as well.\n",
    "```\n",
    "conda install jupyter\n",
    "```\n",
    "1. After finishing work with the notebooks, you may deactivate the environment.\n",
    "```\n",
    "conda deactivate\n",
